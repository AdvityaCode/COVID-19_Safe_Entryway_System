# Covid-19 Safe Entryway System

Michael Fitzmaurice and Advitya Singh

## System Behavior

This system is designed to prevent the spread of disease by ensuring that people entering buildings pass health checks before they are permitted to enter. The two health checks we have decided to focus on were body temperature (to ensure there is no fever), and hand sanitization. We also wanted to design this system in a way that minimized physical contact in order to further prevent the spread of disease.

When the user enters the building, they are greeted by a message prompting them to get their hands sanitized.
